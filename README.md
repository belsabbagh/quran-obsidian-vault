# Quran Obsidian Vault

This is a repo compatible with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that contains the Quran in Arabic. The text is taken from [tanzil.net](http://tanzil.net/) and I've compiled it so that each verse is in its own note. The text is in the public domain.

This project is a work in progress. I'm still working on adding the translations and more metadata.

This should be useful for anyone who wants to reference the Quran in their notes.
